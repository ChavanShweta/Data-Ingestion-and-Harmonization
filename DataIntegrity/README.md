Please note, if data does not conform to the CDM table layout structure, the data load process will fail. And the ingestion process will not be able to move forward. In this case, the error report will be generated and the dataSet will be set aside for a daily review.

We will run the data integrity query if submitted along with the dataSet in order to validate the data counts for each data table and to check for the permissible data value validation.
