Please note, if data does not conform to the CDM table flayout structure, the data load process will fail. And the ingestion process will not be able to move forward. In this case, the error report will be generated and the dataSet will be set aside for a daily review.

The submitted DataSets will run the data integrity query if submitted along with the data in order to validate the data counts for each data table and to permissible data validation checks.
